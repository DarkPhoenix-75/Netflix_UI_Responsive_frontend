# Netflix_UI_Responsive_frontend
My first slight big project: a fully responsive Netflix UI clone built using only HTML and CSS. This project tries to replicates the look and feel of Netflixâ€™s interface, including a responsive navigation bar, hero section, trending rows, and footer, while adapting seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
